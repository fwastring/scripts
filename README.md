# scripts

A collection of bash scripts for my day-to-day computer usage.

## camera

WIP script for importing raw camera images from an SDcard and opening them in darktable.

## dmenu_sys

My go-to "menu" for doing activities such as:
- killing processes
- suspending computer
- rebooting
- shutting off system
- downloading yt videos to my videos directory

## download

The script that downloads the videos from yt using `yt-dlp`.

## passmenu

Slightly modified version of `passmenu`, so that it uses my build of `dmenu` instead.

## utilities

Utilities for adjusting sound output levels and brightness of screen. 
Should maybe be moved to dmenu_sys.

## watch

The script that looks in my `~/videor` folder and allows me to select a video to view using `mpv`.
